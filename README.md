Ransomware is a sort of malicious software that prevents access to a computer system or data unless a specific amount of money is paid. It is a type of cyber extortion that may inflict serious harm to persons and businesses.

Ransomware regularly encrypts data on a user's system, rendering them unavailable, before demanding money in return for the decryption key. It is frequently disseminated by phishing emails, malicious files, or hacked websites.
